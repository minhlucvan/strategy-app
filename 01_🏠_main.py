    ### 📌 Finding an Edge in the VNIndex
    Developing markets like the VNIndex offer unique opportunities and inefficiencies. Here are key factors to consider:
    
    #### 1. **Market Structure Analysis**
    - **Liquidity & Volatility**: Manage risks associated with high volatility and lower liquidity.
    - **Information Asymmetry**: Leverage early or exclusive access to market-moving data.
    
    #### 2. **Fundamental & Macro Factors**
    - **Earnings Surprises**: Capitalize on low analyst coverage and price movements.
    - **Macroeconomic Indicators**: Monitor GDP growth, inflation, and policy shifts.
    
    #### 3. **Behavioral & Technical Insights**
    - **Investor Sentiment**: Exploit emotional overreactions for contrarian trades.
    - **Momentum & Mean Reversion**: Identify trends and price corrections.
